# Handwritten Font Recognition Program

This program utilizes NumPy for implementing handwritten font recognition and Pygame for an interactive interface.

## Instructions

1. Navigate to the folder containing `handwritten_digits_recognition_show_probability.py`.
2. Execute the following command to install the required dependencies:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

   Ensure that the Python modules are installed correctly.

3. Then, execute the following command to run the program:

    ```bash
    python handwritten_digits_recognition_show_probability.py
    ```

   A Pygame window will appear. Use your mouse to write numbers on the black canvas area, and click on the remaining gray areas to refresh. Each small square above shows the probability of each number.
