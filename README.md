<!-- # Handwritten Font Recognition Program

This program utilizes NumPy for implementing handwritten font recognition and Pygame for an interactive interface.

## Instructions

1. Navigate to the folder containing `handwritten_digits_recognition_show_probability.py`.
2. Execute the following command to install the required dependencies:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

   Ensure that the Python modules are installed correctly.

3. Then, execute the following command to run the program:

    ```bash
    python handwritten_digits_recognition_show_probability.py
    ```

   A Pygame window will appear. Use your mouse to write numbers on the black canvas area, and click on the remaining gray areas to refresh. Each small square above shows the probability of each number. -->

   ```bash
   mkdir my_project
   ```

2. **Download the `setup_and_run.py` File:**
   Change directory into the newly created folder (`my_project`) and download the `setup_and_run.py` file from this project's GitHub repository. You can do this by running the following command:
   ```bash
   curl --remote-name https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dopamine333/handwritten_digits_recognition/master/setup_and_run.py
   ```

3. **Navigate to the Folder and Run `setup_and_run.py`:**
   Change directory into the folder where you downloaded the `setup_and_run.py` file. You can do this by running the following command:
   ```bash
   cd my_project
   ```
   Then, execute the `setup_and_run.py` script by running the following command:
    ```bash
